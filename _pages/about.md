Hi! My name is Nick Luong and I am an aspiring Data Scientist eager to learn. I work in analytics in the mental health care space and I am currently also a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, studying data science. My background is in finance and healthcare but I'm eager to work with any type of data that I can get my hands on. I started my career in financial services and ultimately realized so much of the decisions made could be driven by better data-driven tools which is what I realized I wanted to do. 

My strengths lie in my ability to adapt quickly, from working at a major financial institution to doing analytics in a series B mental healthcare startup. I never shy away from trying new technologies or working to become a subject expert in new domains. Feel free to reach out and I would love to share with you about my experience!

Some of my highlighted experiences:
======
### [Predicting Lifetime Value of Users using Machine Learning](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2023/predicting-lifetime-value-users-using-machine-learning)
Worked on a time-series machine learning project with a Non-Disclosure Agreement. Implemented several models (Linear Regression, LSTM, CNN) on time series data provided by a client for analysis to drive insight into the expected performance of the firm.

### [Implementation of NoSQL Databases in the Food Delivery Business](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2023/implementation-nosql-acme-gourmet-meals)
For the final project for Fundamentals of Data Engineering, we presented the use case of implementing NoSQL databases in the food delivery industry. We highlighted the benefits of incorporating tools such as Redis and MongoDB over traditional databases and we showcased Neo4J algorithms, such as Louvain Modularity, to demonstrate how it can help plan future delivery routes.

### Electric Bike Station Mix and Ridership Revenue Performance
Over the course of several weeks, we explored the relationship between the number of traditional vs. E-Bikes in CitiBike Stations across NYC and how they impact revenue per ride. Utilizing R, we designed a linear regression model to understand this relationship and observed that a station that boosted its electric bike availability from an average of 20% to 25%, might see an approx. 5-6% increase in per-ride revenue.
